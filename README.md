# How Computer Works:

computers take input (which can be texte,video,sound...etc) store it in to memory , process it using Algorithms ( a serie of a command ) then output it.

# Data And Binary :

inside of a computer there is wire and circuit and each wire can be represented by **1 or 0** ,by **true or false** or by **on or off**


# Circuit And Logic :

the computer modefie the input which is 1 or 0 into an output usind circuit ,inside these circuits there is a alot of small simple operation all cpmbine together .

# Hardware And software:

hardware and software work together through CPU , a CPU control all the parts of the computer . it does math and logique and send and receive data 
the operating system control all the software of the computer that control the computer hardware .
